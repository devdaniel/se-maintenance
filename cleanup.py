Space Engineers Server Maintenance utility
By David McDonald - Started 12/07/2014

This script is to load a SpaceEngineers save and perform maintenance & cleanup tasks such as;
 - Removal of unneeded objects, multiple classifications of "unneeded"
 - Removal of empty factions & factions that don't own anything
 - Restore asteroids that no one is near (in progress)

It requires a fair chunk of RAM at times because it has to load & parse the large SE save file. Some of those get up to 100MB.

v1.1 15/07/2014
 - Added Junk mode, removing everything without a reaction, regardless of fuel or status.
 - Considered pruning factions without a leader but you might get into strife over factions getting along without a leader,
	 suddenly having base turrets turn on friendlies. Won't do that.
 - Added function to remove all free-floating objects. Doesn't do corpses though, they are more complicated
 - Added whatif mode, like Powershell, doesn't make any changes but tells you what it'll do. Good for debugging
 - Added function to remove junk players, players that don't own anything. Also removes them from factions.
	Considered using players with the <IsDead> attribute True, but that would screw up ownership. 
	Might consider another mode that removes "dead" players and sets ownership of their stuff to "nobody".

v1.1.1 16/07/2014
 - Fixed up Player pruning. Removes player from the FactionPlayer and FactionRequests tables
 - Fixed up Faction pruning. Stopped removing factions who's members don't own anything, will only clear away empty factions now. The player pruner should make this more viable
	Also removes factions from FactionRelations & FactionRequests

#Bum factions are trickier. Look through all of the can-own objects in the world
#Take a list of what playerID owns which blocks
#If none of the members of a faction have ownership of any blocks, disband it
#You'll also need to compensate for objects removed during cleanup
